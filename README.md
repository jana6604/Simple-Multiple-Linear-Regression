Simple-Multiple-Linear-Regression

 Linear Regression Models: Simple & Multiple

 --This repository showcases two foundational regression models implemented in Python using scikit-learn:
 
 --Simple Linear Regression: Predicts house prices based on a single feature (e.g., area in sqft).
 
 --Multiple Linear Regression: Extends the model to predict house prices using multiple features (e.g., area, number of rooms, age of the house).

üóÇÔ∏è What's Included :
 'Simple-Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb'
 
Script for simple linear regression with data visualization.
Script for multiple linear regression using multiple features.

Example screenshots of code and resulting plots for reference.

Key Features:

‚úÖ Implementation of both simple and multiple linear regression

‚úÖ Prediction of target variable for new input data

‚úÖ Visualization of regression line (for simple model)

‚úÖ Easy-to-understand, beginner-friendly code

Example Outputs:
Simple Linear Regression: Predicts price with a regression line plotted.

Multiple Linear Regression: Predicts price based on multiple features.
